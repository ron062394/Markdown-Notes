**What is Markdown?**
``` md
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, designed to be easy to read and write. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of allowing people to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which could then be converted into structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). Markdown is widely used for creating documentation, writing README files for projects, and even writing emails.

## Basic Markdown Syntax
### Headings

### Plain text

This is a sample of a plain text. You use plain text combined with simple symbols to add formatting, which makes the text both readable in its raw form and easily convertible to other formats.
